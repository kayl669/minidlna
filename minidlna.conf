# for the Smasung TV chapter menu while building the database instead of
# generating the MTA file on-the-fly if requested.  Now, consider this: if
# generating MTA files is too slow for on-the-fly generation, the building
# of the database will considerably slow down by setting this to yes!

# No on-thy-fly generation takes place. So, to change this, remove all MTA
# files as well.
